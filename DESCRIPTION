Description: This package applies a resampling method to estimate rotated matrix
    for dimensional reduction. By applying the procedure, a number of new
    dimensions can be used as feature candidates for predictive modeling;
    thus, the number of candidates can be optimized depending on the training
    sample size. This helps to fulfill minimum events per variable (EPV) for a
    machine learning algorithm while optimizing the proportion of variance
    explained (PVE). Unlike other packages for dimensional reduction, this
    package applies resampling methods to prevent overfitting. The PVE
    optimization takes the predicted outcome into account without using it to
    represent the features.
